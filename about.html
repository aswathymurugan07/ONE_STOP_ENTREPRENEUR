          <h3>OBSTACLES FOR YOUTH</h3>
          <br>
          <center><img src="images/young.webp" height="300px" style="float: right;"></center>
            <div style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">
              Not knowing what you're doing means you're unlikely to see and do things the way others have. As a result, those who don't know, innovate.
              <p>Your failures are most likely to lead to success if you get involved with something you believe in. Starting a business just for its own sake will leave you directionless, burned out and ultimately, back where you started. Choose an interest that you can be passionate about. Marrying charity to traditional business models may be a great way to combine the things you – and potential consumers – care most about.</p>

          <div style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">
            Energy and inspiration are contagious. You don't need to go to NFTE events to feel entrepreneurial energy. Entrepreneurship events like business-plan pitch competitions and meet-ups have become so common that there's a great chance there's one going on near you.

Watching other people put their ideas into action is highly motivational and likely to spur and energize even the most jaded or intimidated entrepreneur. Meeting and talking with other entrepreneurs, you're very likely to see that whatever was holding you back, shouldn't.

There's also real value in meeting other people who are interested in entrepreneurs and innovation. Everyone you meet may be a potential mentor, advisor or investor. Chances are, they won't seek you out -- you'll have to go meet them wherever they are. But if you come away with new energy and business cards, the effort is more than worth the time.

        <h3>MENTORSHIP DETAILS</h3>
        <center><img src="images/mentor.webp" height="300px" style="float: right;"></center>
        <div style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">
          Since few people start a business truly and entirely on their own, my experience meeting so many young, first-time entrepreneurs reinforced for me the value of mentors and role models.

In fact, in 2013 the Kauffman Foundation issued a report that identified knowing an entrepreneur as one of the biggest factors in someone's becoming one. It was really easy to see that cause and effect on the young entrepreneurs we hosted at our event. Each one talked about the advice and encouragement he or she received from a teacher or local business leader.

The mentor relationship runs both ways, of course.  </div><br><br><hr>
